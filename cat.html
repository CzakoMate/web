            The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house
            cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
            domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology
            and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred
            in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and
            farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human
            contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to
            kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey
            species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
            reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell
            are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter
            and a crepuscular predator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cat intelligence is evident in their ability to adapt, learn through
            observation, and solve problems, with research showing they possess
            strong memories, exhibit neuroplasticity, and display cognitive
            skills comparable to a young child. Cat communication includes
            meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body
            language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
            human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and
            perceives pheromones.

                The domestic cat originated from Near-Eastern and Egyptian
                populations of the African wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica. The
                family Felidae, to which all living feline species belong, is
                theorized to have arisen about 12 to 13 million years ago and is
                divided into eight major phylogenetic lineages. The Felis
                lineage in particular is the lineage to which the domestic cat
                belongs. Several investigations have shown that all domestic
                varieties of cats come from a single species.

                Cats are carnivores that have highly specialized teeth. There
                are four types of permanent teeth that structure the mouth:
                twelve incisors, four canines, ten premolars and four molars.
                The premolar and first molar are located on each side of the
                mouth that together are called the carnassial pair. The
                carnassial pair specialize in cutting food and are parallel to
                the jaw. The incisors located in the front section of the lower
                and upper mouth are small, narrow, and have a single root.

                Cat senses are adaptations that allow cats to be highly
                efficient predators. Cats are good at detecting movement in low
                light, have an acute sense of hearing and smell, and their sense
                of touch is enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their
                heads and bodies. These senses evolved to allow cats to hunt
                effectively at dawn and dusk. Cats have a tapetum lucidum, which
                is a reflective layer behind the retina that sends light that
                passes through the retina back into the eye.

                Cat intelligence refers to a cat’s ability to solve problems,
                adapt to its environment, learn new behaviors, and communicate
                its needs. Structurally, a cat’s brain shares similarities with
                the human brain,[1] containing around 250 million neurons in the
                cerebral cortex, which is responsible for complex processing.
                Cats display neuroplasticity, allowing their brains to
                reorganize based on experiences. They have well-developed memory
                retaining information for a decade or longer.
